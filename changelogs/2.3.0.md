## Features

- You can now apply presets! As of now there are 3 to choose from:
    + Default - Resets all settings to default
    + OptiFine - Makes Zoomify behave like OptiFine zoom
    + OK Zoomer - Makes Zoomify behave like OK Zoomer defaults (useful for migrating)

- Linear-like zoom setting: make scroll zoom increments appear more linear
    + This was already in Zoomify, but it wasn't able to be turned off.
