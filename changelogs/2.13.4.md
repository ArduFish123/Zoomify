# Zoomify 2.13.4

Implemented the Stonecutter build system to target multiple versions,
like Controlify and YACL!

This comes with the benefit that Zoomify will now receive updates for the older versions,
so the Controlify 2.0 incompatibility is now solved on 1.20.1

## Targets

Zoomify now targets the following Minecraft versions:
- 1.20.1
- 1.20.4 (also supports 1.20.3)
- 1.20.6 (also supports 1.20.5)
Make sure you download the correct version for your Minecraft version!
