# Zoomify 2.11.0

## New Features

Added a live zoom preview to most of the Zoomify settings.

This now allows you to see the effect of your changes without saving,
leaving the menu and entering a world. This should make it easier to configure
all the settings to your liking.

## Language Updates

- Added Vietnamese by [Im Vietnam](https://github.com/ImVietnam) ([#160](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/pull/160)).
- Added Japanese by [co-91](https://github.com/co-91) ([#167](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/pull/167)).
