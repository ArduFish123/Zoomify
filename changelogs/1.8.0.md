- Remove `Zoom Speed` option in favour of `Zoom In Time` and `Zoom Out Time`
which dictates amount of seconds it takes to do said action.
- Added `Relative View Bobbing` option which reduced the amount of bobbing
depending on the zoom level to make walking less jarring.
- Remove `Scroll Zoom Speed` option in favour of `Scroll Zoom Smoothness`.
The higher the smoothness the longer and smoother the scrolling is.
- Remove `Relative Sensitivity Gradient` to reduce down to just the one
`Relative Sensitivity` setting which can be disabled by setting the slider to 0.
- When letting go of the zoom key or toggling zoom off whilst scrolled in,
the normal zoom out transition is used with the same amount of time as if you weren't scrolled.
- Increased number of scroll steps to 30.
